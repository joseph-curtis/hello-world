# Hello-World

Welcome to the `hello-world` repository! This repository serves as an example project featuring templates for various community health files that are crucial for open-source projects. The goal of this repository is to provide a set of well-structured templates that can be used as a reference or starting point for other projects.

## About This Repository

This repository includes templates for the following community health files:

- `README.md`
